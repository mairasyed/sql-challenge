#SQL Challenge- Pewlett Hackard

#Project Overview

The project is for a fictional company named Pewlett Hackard which has hired me as a new data engineer. The main task assigned to me is to do a research project on the employees the company hired during the 1980s and 1990s in my current capacity. The only resources at hand in order to accompalish the task are six CSV files from the employye database. (A few screenshots of the files are attached below).I will be making use of my knowledge and expertise of SQL tools. We have broken down down the task into three parts: 1) data modelling, 2) data engineering & 3) data analysis.
